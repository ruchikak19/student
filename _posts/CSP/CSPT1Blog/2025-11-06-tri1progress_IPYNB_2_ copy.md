# Tools and Set-Up

My tools and set-up journey started off rough, but through consistent troubleshooting, asking questions, and breaking down the problems I faced, I improved a lot. When setting up my venv, I kept running into issues of activating it as I got the same error message every time. After using AI, I was still at the same spot. But I utilized my collaboration skills to network amongst my classmates, which helped me find the root cause of my problem. After testing and retesting different methods to fix it, I arrived at a successful solution, which displayed my problem solving skills. Another problem I faced was making my repo connected to my github login, which I solved with a similar method of collaboration and troubleshooting. By the end of this segment, I was ready and prepared to move on to the next part of CSP material.

# Lessons
I taught the variables lesson at the beginning. A key memory of the lesson was teaching the class the difference between assigning variables in python versus java. A key takeaway was how different variables are declared and stored based on the coding language.

3.2 

I liked how the lesson had a methodical approach and very detailed. I wish the homework was broken down into smaller parts

3.3 

The homework was straightforward and simple and gave me an idea of how code can be used to solve more complex equations

3.4 

Wish the homework didn't involve installing ipywidgets because it took a long time for them to be installed on my computer.

3.5

I liked how the homework covered boolean syntax in both languages and it was simple to do.

3.15

I liked the excape room concept and the activities in the homework

3.6

I liked how the homeworks were organized and the game was nice to give an explanation of the topic

3.7 

This lesson was explained well, and the interactive homeworks helped me understand the concept better.

3.8

This is a key topic so it was helpful to learn about loops and their syntax in both languages.

3.9

I liked the peppa pig maze concept and how the algorithms take place in the code for games. The homework was also interactive and helpful

3.10

It was helpful to learn about how to store and call data using lists instead of manually writing out variables

3.12

This took really long, and I wish it focused more on coding on VSCode. But this was something new to learn about in a real-world example

3.13

It was a very interactive lesson on how procedures work and how to implement them in coding

3.17

This was a helpful homework in understanding how to make code more efficient so it can save time for you and enhance your coding knowledge


## Reflection

Overall, these homeworks and lessons gave me a great reintroduction to commonly use and foundational computer science principles which will be very beneficial for the AP exam and understanding the logic behind writing basic code. I enjoyed the fact that other made interactive lessons and homeworks to reinforce the taught concepts and make an engaging activity to learn computer science principles.


# Digital Famine Class Project

🌐 Digital Famine Project — My Experience in the AI Team

During the Digital Famine Group Project, I was part of the AI sub-team, where I worked specifically on submodules 2 and 4. My main contribution was creating a blog on prompt engineering, exploring different types of prompt strategies and how they can improve AI-generated results. I also created the final mini game, featuring a drag-and-drop MCQ to escape the planet.

🤝 Collaboration Experience

Working in the AI group was a great team experience. We communicated frequently, shared resources, and supported each other throughout the project. Everyone contributed unique strengths, and it helped us move efficiently and creatively. I really appreciated how smoothly the collaboration went — from brainstorming ideas to dividing tasks and reviewing work.

🧠 What I Worked On: Prompt Engineering

I focused on researching and writing a blog about different types of prompt engineering techniques. These included:

Experience-based prompting — Using learned patterns and previous interactions to refine prompts

Structured prompt design — Crafting prompts with clear instructions, role assignment, and context

Iterative prompting — Improving responses by adjusting and refining prompts step by step

Zero-shot & Few-shot prompting — Getting the AI to perform tasks with little to no examples

The goal was to help others understand how thoughtful prompt design can dramatically improve AI performance, especially in research and digital problem-solving contexts like food insecurity and digital famine studies.

I also focused on integration of drag-and-drop in the code to make an interactive final game experience. 

🎯 Challenges

While working on the project, I faced a few challenges:

Summarizing technical concepts in a way that was easy to understand

Ensuring content was accurate, ethical, and relevant to the theme

Balancing AI-related details with the broader project narrative on Digital Famine

Through research and feedback from teammates, I was able to overcome these challenges and produce a clear and meaningful blog post.

Making the drag and drop game module deploy correctly and constant troubleshooting of the code. 

✨ Takeaways

This project helped me:

Improve my prompt engineering skills

Understand the role of AI in addressing digital inequity

Practice team communication and content design

Gain confidence in presenting technical concepts clearly

Overall, this was a valuable learning experience and strengthened both my technical and collaborative skills.

## Observation

I also enjoyed observing CSSE's game at N@TM as it exhibited creativity, collaboration and teamwork. This is because it connected elements from each submodule like the skeleton key game and the haunted mansion to make an enjoyable game experience. What I liked most were the visuals that were present in the games as they made it interactive and aesthetically pleasing to play and view.
