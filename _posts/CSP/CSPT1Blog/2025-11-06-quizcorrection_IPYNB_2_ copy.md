# AP Classroom Quiz Evaluation

I received a 49/66 or a 74.2% on the 2018 Mock MCQ. I learned a lot during the process including working with pseudocode and understanding the algorithm notations which will be used on the AP exam!

## Corrections

10: Draw circle function 
- I chose A, but the correct answer was B because you had to subtract 2 from the y position, not add 2

13: Social Media hypothesis
- I chose A, but the right answer was B because the trend of the average messages sent didn't stay constant, but increased. The true interpretation of the data was that the app led to people writing shorter messages.

22: Weather procedure
- I chose A, but the right answer was B because the counter needed to be greater than 1/2 of the total, not less than

28: Binary sequence
- I chose A, which represented only 16 possible bits, but there need to be 2^8 bits to represent 200 characters

29: Logic gates
- I chose B, but the right answer was A because A or B needed to be true, not both

30: Streaming
- I chose D, but the right answer was A because the analysis would run multiple times, accounting for a longer time span.

37: Average computing
- I chose D, but the right answer was C because I switched the amount of time it would take to run the program.

42: Bit representation
- I chose D, but the right answer was A because, the procedure would give 2^96 addresses available

43: Runtime
- I chose B, but the right answer was A because I thought O(n^2) time complexity wan not reasonable, but it apparently is.

45: NAND logic gate
- I chose C, but the right answer was A because the NOT should addres P and Q together

46: Infinite loops
- I chose D, but the right answer was B because it is not possible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs.

47: Public key cryptography
- I chose D, but the right answer was B because the sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message.

50: Searching list
- I chose C, but the right answer was A because the procedure implements a linear search, but the list does not need to be sorted.

58: Crowdsourcing 
- I chose D, but the right answer was A because option III is incorrect because there are some problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time.

61: Data analysis
- I chose D, but the right answer was A because East High School provides the ZIP code of each student, but West High School does not.

65: Correcting errors
- I chose C, but the right answer was B because y can't be negative as the count starts at 0

66: Smallest procedure test
- I chose D, but the right answer was A because the list needs to be sorted with smalelr numbers in the front

## Reflection

🔍 What I Learned
Going through my corrections, I realized that many of my mistakes stemmed from misreading the logic or making assumptions too quickly. For example:
- Procedural logic: In questions like #10 and #22, I misjudged how small changes in conditions (like subtracting vs. adding, or comparing to half the total) could flip the outcome.
- Data interpretation: Question #13 reminded me that trends in data aren’t always obvious—context matters. I learned to look beyond surface-level patterns.
- Binary and bit representation: Questions like #28 and #42 pushed me to think more precisely about how data is stored and represented. I now better understand how exponential growth applies to bit capacity.
- Algorithmic efficiency: #43 challenged my assumptions about runtime complexity. I learned that even quadratic time can be reasonable depending on the context.
- Logic gates and cryptography: Questions like #29, #45, and #47 helped reinforce how Boolean logic and encryption principles work in practice—not just in theory.

💡 Takeaways
- Slow down and analyze: Many errors came from rushing through the logic or misinterpreting the question. I should have to pause and visualize the algorithm or data flow before choosing an answer.
- Review foundational concepts: Revisiting topics like searching algorithms, logic gates, and runtime complexity will help solidify my understanding.
