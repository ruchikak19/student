    "# AP Classroom Quiz Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "I received a 49/66 or a 74.2% on the 2018 Mock MCQ. I learned a lot during the process including working with pseudocode and understanding the algorithm notations which will be used on the AP exam!\n",

    "## Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "10: Draw circle function \n",
    "- I chose A, but the correct answer was B because you had to subtract 2 from the y position, not add 2\n",
    "\n",
    "13: Social Media hypothesis\n",
    "- I chose A, but the right answer was B because the trend of the average messages sent didn't stay constant, but increased. The true interpretation of the data was that the app led to people writing shorter messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "22: Weather procedure\n",
    "- I chose A, but the right answer was B because the counter needed to be greater than 1/2 of the total, not less than\n",
    "\n",
    "28: Binary sequence\n",
    "- I chose A, which represented only 16 possible bits, but there need to be 2^8 bits to represent 200 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "29: Logic gates\n",
    "- I chose B, but the right answer was A because A or B needed to be true, not both\n",
    "\n",
    "30: Streaming\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was A because the analysis would run multiple times, accounting for a longer time span.\n",
    "\n",
    "37: Average computing\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was C because I switched the amount of time it would take to run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "42: Bit representation\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was A because, the procedure would give 2^96 addresses available\n",
    "\n",
    "43: Runtime\n",
    "- I chose B, but the right answer was A because I thought O(n^2) time complexity wan not reasonable, but it apparently is.\n",
    "\n",
    "45: NAND logic gate\n",
    "- I chose C, but the right answer was A because the NOT should addres P and Q together\n",
    "\n",
    "46: Infinite loops\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was B because it is not possible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "47: Public key cryptography\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was B because the sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "50: Searching list\n",
    "- I chose C, but the right answer was A because the procedure implements a linear search, but the list does not need to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "58: Crowdsourcing \n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was A because option III is incorrect because there are some problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "61: Data analysis\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was A because East High School provides the ZIP code of each student, but West High School does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "65: Correcting errors\n",
    "- I chose C, but the right answer was B because y can't be negative as the count starts at 0\n",
    "\n",
    "66: Smallest procedure test\n",
    "- I chose D, but the right answer was A because the list needs to be sorted with smalelr numbers in the front\n",

    "🔍 What I Learned\n",
    "Going through my corrections, I realized that many of my mistakes stemmed from misreading the logic or making assumptions too quickly. For example:\n",
    "- Procedural logic: In questions like #10 and #22, I misjudged how small changes in conditions (like subtracting vs. adding, or comparing to half the total) could flip the outcome.\n",
    "- Data interpretation: Question #13 reminded me that trends in data aren’t always obvious—context matters. I learned to look beyond surface-level patterns.\n",
    "- Binary and bit representation: Questions like #28 and #42 pushed me to think more precisely about how data is stored and represented. I now better understand how exponential growth applies to bit capacity.\n",
    "- Algorithmic efficiency: #43 challenged my assumptions about runtime complexity. I learned that even quadratic time can be reasonable depending on the context.\n",
    "- Logic gates and cryptography: Questions like #29, #45, and #47 helped reinforce how Boolean logic and encryption principles work in practice—not just in theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Takeaways\n",
    "- Slow down and analyze: Many errors came from rushing through the logic or misinterpreting the question. I should have to pause and visualize the algorithm or data flow before choosing an answer.\n",
    "- Review foundational concepts: Revisiting topics like searching algorithms, logic gates, and runtime complexity will help solidify my understanding.\n",
