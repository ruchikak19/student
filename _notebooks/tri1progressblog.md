# Tools and Set-Up

My tools and set-up journey started off rough, but through consistent troubleshooting, asking questions, and breaking down the problems I faced, I improved a lot. When setting up my venv, I kept running into issues of activating it as I got the same error message every time. After using AI, I was still at the same spot. But I utilized my collaboration skills to network amongst my classmates, which helped me find the root cause of my problem. After testing and retesting different methods to fix it, I arrived at a successful solution, which displayed my problem solving skills. Another problem I faced was making my repo connected to my github login, which I solved with a similar method of collaboration and troubleshooting. By the end of this segment, I was ready and prepared to move on to the next part of CSP material.

# Lessons
I taught the variables lesson at the beginning. A key memory of the lesson was teaching the class the difference between assigning variables in python versus java. A key takeaway was how different variables are declared and stored based on the coding language.

3.2 

I liked how the lesson had a methodical approach and very detailed. I wish the homework was broken down into smaller parts

3.3 

The homework was straightforward and simple and gave me an idea of how code can be used to solve more complex equations

3.4 

Wish the homework didn't involve installing ipywidgets because it took a long time for them to be installed on my computer.

3.5

I liked how the homework covered boolean syntax in both languages and it was simple to do.

3.15

I liked the excape room concept and the activities in the homework

3.6

I liked how the homeworks were organized and the game was nice to give an explanation of the topic

3.7 

This lesson was explained well, and the interactive homeworks helped me understand the concept better.

3.8

This is a key topic so it was helpful to learn about loops and their syntax in both languages.

3.9

I liked the peppa pig maze concept and how the algorithms take place in the code for games. The homework was also interactive and helpful

3.10

It was helpful to learn about how to store and call data using lists instead of manually writing out variables

3.12

This took really long, and I wish it focused more on coding on VSCode. But this was something new to learn about in a real-world example

3.13

It was a very interactive lesson on how procedures work and how to implement them in coding

3.17

This was a helpful homework in understanding how to make code more efficient so it can save time for you and enhance your coding knowledge


## Reflection

Overall, these homeworks and lessons gave me a great reintroduction to commonly use and foundational computer science principles which will be very beneficial for the AP exam and understanding the logic behind writing basic code. I enjoyed the fact that other made interactive lessons and homeworks to reinforce the taught concepts and make an engaging activity to learn computer science principles.
